		<h2>Add-ons</h2>
		
		The add-on system allows the aggregation of new functions to
		the application, in an organized way.
		
		<h2>Code structure</h2>
		
		<p>
			To create an add-on, you must implement the methods <code>load(ctrl)</code>
			and <code>unload</code>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The <code>load(ctrl)</code> is responsible to
			load the add-on (i.e: add a button to the interface, etc), and receives
			the application controller (<code>core.MainController</code>).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The <code>unload</code> is called only one time, when the main
			application is closing, and it's intended to release resources
			(that needs special care, like files) used by the add-on.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You also need to create an info table with the following members:
			<ul>
				<li>name</li>
				<li>description</li>
				<li>authors</li>
				<li>version</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The file <code>addons/Sample.lua</code> implements a very simple
			add-on, and can be used as base for new add-ons.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Activating the add-on</h2>
		
		<p>
			You can select which add-ons (and their order) that will be loaded
			when the application starts by editing the list in
			<code>addons/List.lua</code>.
