This directory contains the code for a simple Windows install/uninstall
package. The "makeinstall" program takes a list of files (in "filelist") to
install, and produces a compressed copy of these files, which are placed
into the resources of the "setup" program. This program installs the listed
files to a target machine, and sets up the necessary registry keys for the
"uninstall" program to then be able to remove those files again. The only
file that should need to be distributed, therefore, is "setup.exe".
