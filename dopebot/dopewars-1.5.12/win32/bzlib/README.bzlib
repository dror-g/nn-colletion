If you are intending to build the Win32 installer for dopewars, then place
the bzlib distribution (from http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/) into this
directory. The installer expects to statically link with the file libbz2.a
in this directory; the libbz2.a file included in the Cygwin distribution
should _not_ be used, as this requires the CYGWIN.DLL file, which is not
a standard Windows DLL. Use the Makefile.nocygwin file to compile bzlib,
as this adds in the -mno-cygwin flag.
