If you are intending to build the Win32 installer for dopewars, then place
the zlib distribution into this directory. The installer expects to
statically link with the file libz.a in this directory; the libz.a file
included in the Cygwin distribution should _not_ be used, as this requires
the CYGWIN.DLL file, which is not a standard Windows DLL. Use the
Makefile.nocygwin file to compile zlib, as this adds in the -mno-cygwin flag.
