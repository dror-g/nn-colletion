     dopewars-1.5.7 released. There is now sound support (ESD and/or SDL
on Unix systems, WinMM on Win32) although you have to provide your own WAVs

then they can be included in future releases). Some minor bugs have been
fixed, and overall security has been tightened up.

29th April 2002

client in non-UTF8 locales, fixes a server memory corruption bug, and adds
extra sanity checks to the server to foil cheating clients.

10th September 2000
     The dopewars project, previously hosted solely at
http://bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~ben/dopewars/ now has an additional home at
SourceForge! This is to allow developers easier access to development codes
(by CVS) and to take advantage of SourceForge's mailing lists and forums.
Translators are particularly needed for translation of the development
version of the dopewars code into other languages!

2nd August 2000
    The German translation now has its home at
http://www.ideenpark.de/dopewars/. This site also mirrors the original
English version of the program.  

28th July 2000

http://www.rLUG.de/files/dopewars-german/.

metaserver interface - new servers now report game data, such as current
number of players and high scores, to the metaserver. Several bugs, mainly
in the Win32 networking code, have been fixed.

2nd July 2000
     A mirror in the US is now available for dopewars downloads. Follow the US
links (as opposed to the UK links) on the download page to download from this
site.

14th January 2000
     dopewars 1.4.7 released. This now uses autoconf to build on a variety
of "odd" Unices, and also "out of the box" under Cygwin (Win32). Servers for
which the IP is incorrectly resolved by the metaserver can now set a
preferred hostname with the "MetaServer.LocalName" variable.

21st October 1999 
     dopewars 1.4.5 released. Client players can now be instructed to connect to
the metaserver, to present a "nice" list of available servers for the user to
select from; more configuration options; metaserver almost works with web
proxies now.

11th October 1999 
     Snapshots of the latest in-development version of dopewars are now made
available on a semi-regular basis at the main download page. HTML documentation
is also now available.

16th September 1999 
     dopewars 1.4.4 released. This handles connection to the new metaserver
automatically, so that the list of dopewars servers can be easily kept up to
date. Other minor changes fix small bugs from earlier versions.

15th September 1999 
     Servers can now be registered by completing the form at 
http://bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~ben/dopewars/serverform.html. The upcoming
version 1.4.4 of dopewars will be able to handle the connection to the web and
the completion of registration details automatically.

23rd June 1999

adding any new bugs) such as much better fight handling, and the ability to
customise dopewars servers and clients.

     dopewars 1.4.1 released. This fixes a bug with the loan shark, which was
discovered by several people quick off the mark; dunno how that slipped past my
team of beta testers here at Oxford - they're obviously too busy doing "real"
work!

27th April 1999 
     First GPL release of dopewars (1.4.0)
