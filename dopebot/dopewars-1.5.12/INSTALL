PREREQUISITES
=============

dopewars _requires_ the GLib library for compilation, even when not using
the GTK+ client. Other libraries may be required for additional features:-

Unix/Linux:
   - Get GLib from http://www.gtk.org/
   - For the GTK+ client, GTK+ libraries are needed, also from
     http://www.gtk.org/. To actually compile dopewars, you'll probably need
     your distribution's "gtk-devel" package.
   - For the curses client, curses, ncurses or libcurses_color libraries
     and headers are required.

Windows:
   - Get Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com/. It should be possible to build
     dopewars with C compilers other than Cygwin, but this is not supported.
     Make sure that when you install Cygwin you select the following packages
     for installation:
         pkgconfig gettext libiconv w32api mingw-runtime gcc make bash unzip
   - If you want to build from CVS, you will also need the following:-
         autoconf automake gettext-devel
   - dopewars requires GLib for Win32, which in turn requires libintl and
     libiconv. Links to the binary distributions of these can be found at
     http://www.gimp.org/win32/downloads.html. (You can also build them from
     the source code, but this is not described here.) The binary packages
     that you will need are:
         glib-2.4.7.zip
         glib-dev-2.4.7.zip
         libiconv-1.9.1.bin.woe32.zip
         gettext-0.14.5.zip
         gettext-dev-0.14.5.zip
     Later versions of any of these packages should also work. Note that the
     libintl and libiconv Cygwin packages will NOT suffice here.
   - These packages need to be installed on your Cygwin system under /target,
     so start a Cygwin shell, and execute something similar to the following:
         mkdir -p /target
         cd /target
         unzip /glib-2.4.7.zip
         unzip /glib-dev-2.4.7.zip
         unzip /gettext-0.14.5.zip
         unzip /gettext-dev-0.14.5.zip
         unzip /libiconv-1.9.1.bin.woe32.zip
   - In order for pkg-config to detect the installed packages, you need
     to put their .pc files (in /target/lib/pkgconfig) in the pkgconfig
     search path. One way of doing this is with the following command:
         ln -s /target/lib/pkgconfig /lib/pkgconfig
   - In order for the configure script to properly detect libintl, it needs to
     be placed in the include path:
         ln -s /target/include/libintl.h /usr/include/mingw
   - Finally, in order for GLib applications such as dopewars to work, the
     libintl, libiconv and libglib DLLs need to be in the Windows library
     search path. You can either copy them into the dopewars directory, or
     place them somewhere such as C:\WINNT\System32, either with Windows
     Explorer or with a Cygwin command such as:
         cd /target
         cp bin/intl.dll bin/iconv.dll \
            bin/libglib-2.0-0.dll /cygdrive/c/winnt/system32


INSTALLATION
============

dopewars installation should require no more than the following:-

	./configure
	make
	make install

(To build a CVS version, you must have the automake and autoconf packages
installed. Run ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure - this generates the
Makefiles and configure script. You will also need the gettext package if
you want to enable NLS support, in order to generate the necessary .po files.)

The configure script checks to see if your system is a "normal" Unix or the
Unix-under-Win32 "Cygwin" environment. On a Cygwin system, the default is to
build a native Win32 binary with the Cygwin tools; this will then run without
requiring the presence and performance penalty of the CYGWIN.DLL library. This
test can be overridden (if, for example, you wanted to build the Unix version
under Cygwin) with the --enable-nativewin32 option to configure e.g.

to build the Win32 binary under Cygwin
	./configure
	(Cygwin should be automatically detected)
or
	./configure --enable-nativewin32

to build the Unix version under Cygwin
	./configure --disable-nativewin32

For a smaller binary, you may wish to build a "stripped" binary by specifying
the -s option in LDFLAGS. In a Bourne-compatible shell, this can be achieved
with a command similar to the following:-
	LDFLAGS="-s" ./configure

The dopewars high score file is written as /usr/local/var/dopewars.sco on
Unix systems or ./dopewars.sco on Win32 systems by default. On Unix systems,
translations, documentation, sounds and graphics are installed in the
locale, doc, dopewars and pixmaps directories respectively under
/usr/local/share. (On Windows systems, these directories are under the
current directory.) On Unix systems, you can move the score file with the
--localstatedir flag to configure, and the other files with the --datadir
flag. (On Win32 systems, the --localstatedir and --datadir flags are
ignored.) The dopewars binary can also be moved from /usr/local/bin/dopewars
with the --bindir flag. For example:-

	./configure --bindir=/usr/bin --localstatedir=/var/lib/games
will configure the system to write the dopewars binary as /usr/bin/dopewars
and the high score as /var/lib/games/dopewars.sco

Other options to ./configure include:-

--enable-networking:
	Compile dopewars with support for running as a server, and/or to
connect to existing servers over a TCP/IP network. (Without networking,
dopewars will only be useable in single-player mode.) If this option is not
specified, the configure script will enable networking only if it believes
your system has the necessary support functions (select and socket). You can
also explicitly disable networking with --enable-networking=no or
--disable-networking

--enable-gui-client:
	Compile a graphical dopewars client, using GTK+ on Unix systems and
the standard libaries under Windows. If unspecified, this is enabled only
if your system has the necessary libraries (e.g. GTK+) installed.

--enable-curses-client:
	Compile a text-mode client, using ncurses or similar on Unix systems
and the standard libraries under Windows. If unspecified, this is enabled only
if you have ncurses (or similar) installed.

--enable-gui-server:
	Use a (very basic) graphical interface to the dopewars server. If not
specified, this is enabled under Windows and disabled under Unix (where a
simple text-mode server is used instead).

--enable-strict
	If using gcc to compile dopewars (recommended) then this turns on
extra warning messages (useful for debugging, etc.) Unfortunately a lot of
these warnings can be safely ignored, so this is not the default.

WIN32 INSTALLER
===============

In order to build the Win32 installer program for dopewars, place the
libbzip2 source code (from http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/) into
win32/bzlib, and build it with

    make -f Makefile.nocygwin

Then you should be able to build setup.exe by simply executing "make" in
the win32 directory.

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
